# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nathan Tamez, CS student and Software Engineer. I like to build anything from Dynamic web applications to CLI tools and even play around with embedded programming (Adreno and Raspberry Pi pico manly).

My interests include Space (the tech and rocket side of things particular), Science fiction and A bit of Formula One.
